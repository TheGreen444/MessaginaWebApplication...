after learning php and web languages after i shifted to web penetisting and so on to cyber stuffs i again opend this repo hosted this site and found out there are some vernabilities those are:
after you send a message from network tab you can copy that request as curl and change uername/id and other options available there you will be able to send message to others from others behaf,
you can send load messages of dm of other 2 users with user id if you found out, and so on some other bugs I forgot to make it like that its been a while and i am boared to fix that haha if you are using this fix it...

and if you are using this make sure after hosting that directorys and .txt files containing sensetive info will be blocked when requested externally like put denly on them in .htaaccess and more...
